# Kaggle-Competition-Laptop-Prices
In this [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/precio-portatiles-the-bridge), the aim is to obtain a price prediction (regression model) for laptops according to their brands and features in order to launch them at a competitive price into the market.
The dataset has the following fields:
1. Company- String -Laptop Manufacturer
2. Product -String -Brand and Model
3. TypeName -String -Type (Notebook, Ultrabook, Gaming, etc.)
4. Inches -Numeric- Screen Size
5. ScreenResolution -String- Screen Resolution
6. Cpu- String -Central Processing Unit (CPU)
7. Ram -String- Laptop RAM
8. Memory -String- Hard Disk / SSD Memory
9. GPU -String- Graphics Processing Units (GPU)
10. OpSys -String- Operating System
11. Weight -String- Laptop Weight
12. Price_euros -Numeric- Price (Euro)
The syntax of the fields is quite messy, which means there will be a lot of feature engineering to do!
